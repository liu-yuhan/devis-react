# to improve

Correct the "Quantit√©" in table, it should display the "locations[n].quantite",
but it is displaying "lots[n].quantite" for now.

So as "Total HT", it should be "locations[n].quantite \* Prix unitaire",
but not "lots[n].prixHT".

Display N/A when there is no element in this location.

Browse on a single route.

Add a price total calculation for each location in each sub-estimate.
