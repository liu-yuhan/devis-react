# devis-react

This application is developed for browsing the estimate, fetched from API:
https://api.travauxlib.com/api/devis-pro/JKusHl8Ba8MABIjdCtLZOe2lxxnUfX
It uses axios to connect the API, functions can be found in /src/api_connection.

The appilication can filter the estimate by professions, each sub-estimate is an independent component. They can be found in /src/container.

The application is using Redux as state manager, the configuration is in /src/redux.

# To improve

Correct the "Quantit√©" in table, it should display the "locations[n].quantite",
but it is displaying "lots[n].quantite" for now.

So as "Total HT", it should be "locations[n].quantite \* Prix unitaire",
but not "lots[n].prixHT".

Browse on a single route. Create a function to switch lots[n], that factors the current separate independant components that are mostly copy/pasted for now for each sub-estimate.

Create a function to filter the elements in each location, the are using the same code but copy/pasted for now.

Display N/A when there is no element in this location.

Add a price total calculation for each location in each sub-estimate.
